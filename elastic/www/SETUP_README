PHP files you may wish to change:

app/config/auth.php
app/config/main.php
app/components/AmazonWS.php
app/views/layouts/main.php

In case of a necessary migration, the following is a list of dependencies:

PHP >= 5.2 with MySQL support, PDO support, Amazon's Web Services support
--( http://pear.amazonwebservices.com/ )
MySQL >= 5.0.51a
curl
Apache2
--With mod_rewrite, mod_curl, mod_ssl

Specific Yii dependencies can be viewed by downloading the yii framework
separately and viewing the requirements/index.php page. With curl and PDO
it should be fine.

Server-side should uncomment the https lines in html/.htaccess and
change the public IPs in the crontab. Important passwords and other
credentials should be stored in app/config/auth.php.
